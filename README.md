# TRPC Project Setup with Express and Vue

This project is a setup for a TRPC (TypeScript Remote Procedure Call) implementation using Express for the server-side and Vue for the client-side. The project is built with TypeScript and uses the following technologies:

- TypeScript (for both the server and client)
- Express (for the server-side)
- Vue (for the client-side)

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the `express_server` directory and run `npm install` to install the server-side dependencies.
Run `npm run dev:server` to start the server in development mode.
Navigate to the `vue_client` directory and run `npm install` to install the client-side dependencies.
Run `npm run dev` to start the client in development mode.
Usage
Once the server and client are up and running, you can start making TRPC requests.

## Acknowledgments
Thank you to the creators of Express and Vue for providing the tools to build this project.
